# emergency-lights-mod

A simple emergency lights mod(/elm) for SA:MP.

## Notes
I added random includes because I couldn't be arsed to look for the exact ones needed - these includes are not in the repo, you must obtain them yourselves.

I'm releasing this in a way that you can copy the codes off and place them onto your script instead of using it as a filterscript(I don't really know if it will even work, like I said it's just for you guys to get the code not to use it as a FS)

##If I helped you in any way...
Consider giving me some reputation, it'd be appreciated!
